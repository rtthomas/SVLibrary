## Samos Volunteers Library System
This is a rudimentary system for managing book lending. I developed it while in Greece with the [Samos Volunteers](http://samosvolunteers.org/) organization. 
The server is a Google App Engine application backed by Google Datastore, with an Angular/Bootstrap client. 

The folder hierarchy is that of a an Eclipse project created with the Google Cloud plugin, plus a client folder for the Angular client app.
